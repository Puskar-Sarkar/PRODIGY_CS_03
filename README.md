# PRODIGY_CS_03
This project is part of my Cyber Security Internship at Prodigy InfoTech. It evaluates the strength of a password based on common security criteria such as length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The tool provides real-time feedback to help users improve their password security.
